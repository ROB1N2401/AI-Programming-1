# AI Programming 
This repository contains three Unity projects made within the Uppsala University course: 
"[AI Programming 1](https://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kKod=5SD806&lasar=)".

### Behaviour Tree 3D
In this project 3 teams compete for a victory in a race. 
In each team there are 3 agents, and each agent has a unique role in a team that utilizes its own Behaviour Tree. <br>
Inside the project folder there is a README that explains agents' roles and race rules.

### Pathfinding Algorithms
This project is a small simulation of a spaceship that looks for fallen stars in space and then delivers them to the market. It utilizes A* algorithm for 
pathfinding and FSM for behaviour. <br> 
Inside the project folder there is a README that explains spaceship's behaviour rules and program's controls.

### Sense Decide Act
This project simulates a small ecosystem, consisting of grass, sheep and wolves. All entites in the world operate through "Sense-Decide-Act" logic loop to 
gather external information and update their behaviour accordingly. <br>
Inside the project folder there is a README that explains all entities' behaviour and by what it is informed, as well as program's symbols.
